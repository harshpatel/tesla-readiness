üí° **Remember it:** Medical terms = PREFIX + WORD ROOT + SUFFIX + COMBINING FORM. The combining form is usually a vowel (like ''o'' or ''i'') that connects word parts to make pronunciation easier. Like ''cardi/o/logy'' - the ''o'' is the combining form that smoothly connects ''cardi'' (heart) to ''logy'' (study of)!',

üí° **Remember it:** The COMBINING FORM is usually a VOWEL (o, i, a) that acts like GLUE between word parts to make them easier to say. Without it, words would sound clunky! Compare ''cardlogy'' (ugh!) vs ''cardi-O-logy'' (smooth!). It''s the pronunciation helper!',

üí° **Remember it:** MOST combining forms are vowels (like ''o'' in gastr-o-logy), but sometimes consonants can be used. The key is that they make pronunciation easier - that''s their job! Don''t assume 100% vowel - think ''pronunciation helper'' instead!',

üí° **Remember it:** The SUFFIX at the END determines if a word is a NOUN (a thing/person/place) or ADJECTIVE (describing word). Like hepat-IC (adjective: relating to liver) vs hepat-ITIS (noun: inflammation of liver). The suffix transforms the word root into different parts of speech!',

üí° **Remember it:** IN-FLAME-ation = literally IN FLAMES! When your body detects injury or infection, it sends blood and immune cells causing the area to be RED (blood flow), HOT (increased temperature), SWOLLEN (fluid buildup), PAINFUL.

üí° **Remember it:** SYMPTOM = what the PATIENT feels/reports (''I have a cough''). SIGN = what others can SEE/HEAR/MEASURE (''I hear you coughing''). A COUGH is both - the patient FEELS the urge and reports it (symptom) AND others can HEAR it happening (sign). Some things cross over!',
