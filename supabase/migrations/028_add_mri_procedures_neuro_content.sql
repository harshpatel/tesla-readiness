Think of looking through a camera viewfinder - do you zoom in close (small FOV like 18cm for a tiny joint) or zoom out wide (large FOV like 48cm for the whole pelvis)? Slice thickness is how THICK each slice is (like bread thickness), but FOV is the LENGTH √ó WIDTH of the actual image area. Brain FOV = usually 24cm. Knee FOV = usually 16cm.

Touch the bridge of your nose between your eyebrows - that smooth, flat area is the GLABELLA. For brain MRI, you can use either the NASION (the very top of the nose bridge where it meets the forehead) OR the GLABELLA (just below that, between the brows). Both get you centered on the brain. Not the tip of the nose (too far forward), not the chin (way too low). Glabella = eyebrow midpoint!',

CALVARIUM = the top of the skull (skull cap). For BRAIN imaging, you start at the FORAMEN MAGNUM (bottom) and go ALL THE WAY UP to the CALVARIUM (top) - you want to capture THE ENTIRE BRAIN from bottom to top! Not just to C1 (that''s too low, you''d miss the cerebellum). Not just to ACPC line (that''s only mid-brain, you''d miss the top). FULL BRAIN = foramen magnum ‚û°Ô∏è calvarium!',

MS (can have spinal cord lesions), tumors (can be in/around spine), and DDD (degenerative disc disease = worn-out discs) are all SPINE problems. But chest pain?

For C-SPINE imaging, the landmark is the BASE (bottom) of the CHIN. Not the nasion (that''s for brain - way too high). Not the mandible angle (side of jaw - not consistent). BASE OF CHIN gets you centered on the CERVICAL spine (C1-C7). Think: CHIN = CERVICAL. Both start with "C"! Easy peasy!',

    '**Perpendicular to the spinal cord** = Cut across it! ‚úÇÔ∏è\n\nüí° **Remember it:** PERPENDICULAR = 90¬∞ angle = ACROSS! For axial spine images, you want to cut PERPENDICULAR (across) the spinal CORD, like slicing a hot dog into circular coins! NOT parallel (that would be lengthwise, like slicing a hot dog into a long half). The cervical spine has a natural curve (lordosis), so you ANGLE your slices to stay perpendicular to the cord''s path as it curves.

    '**Mid sternum** = T-spine landmark! üéØ\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Put your hand on the MIDDLE of your BREASTBONE (sternum) - that''s about T5-T7 level (middle of thoracic spine T1-T12). Not the top (that''s too high, near C7/T1), not the bottom (that''s getting into lumbar territory). MID STERNUM = MID THORACIC. The sternum is that flat bone in the center of your chest that your ribs attach to. Touch the center of your chest - that''s your landmark for centering T-spine!',

    '**1"-2" above the iliac crest** = L-spine landmark! üìè\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Put your hands on your hips - those bony points you feel are the ILIAC CRESTS (top of your hip bones). Now move up about 1-2 inches (about 2-5 cm) - that''s roughly L2-L3 level (middle of lumbar spine L1-L5). NOT at the iliac crest itself (that''s L4-L5, too low), and definitely not at the sternum (way too high) or pubis (pelvic bone, way too low). 1"-2" ABOVE iliac crest = sweet spot for L-spine centering!',

This ensures you capture all 5 lumbar vertebrae (L1-L5) PLUS one above (T12) and one below (S1) for context. T12 ‚û°Ô∏è L1-L5 ‚û°Ô∏è S1 = complete coverage!',

These are two tiny white matter structures in the MIDDLE of your brain that connect the two hemispheres. The ACPC LINE is like the brain''s "equator" - a reliable INTERNAL landmark that runs front-to-back through the center of the brain. By angling your axial slices PARALLEL to the ACPC line, you get standardized, reproducible brain images that look the same every time and match anatomy atlases.

On sagittal MRI, it looks like a gray, egg-shaped structure right in the CENTER of the brain, just below the corpus callosum. The thalamus is your brain''s RELAY STATION - almost ALL sensory information (except smell) passes through the thalamus before going to the cortex. Think: THALAMUS = THE ALMOST US - almost everything goes through it to get to "us" (consciousness). It''s that gray egg in the middle!',

On sagittal MRI, the brainstem has 3 parts from top to bottom: midbrain (small), PONS (the big bulge/bridge), and medulla (the tail going down to spinal cord). The PONS is the THICK MIDDLE SECTION that "bridges" the upper brain to the lower brainstem and cerebellum. Look for the bump in the middle of the brainstem - that''s your pons!',

C1 (atlas) is the first one at the very top (holds up your head like Atlas holding the world). C2 (axis) is RIGHT BELOW C1 and has a special "tooth" (dens/odontoid process) that sticks UP into C1, allowing your head to rotate.

Think of vertebrae like a ring: the BODY is the thick front part (anterior), and the arch wraps around the back to protect the spinal cord. On axial (cross-section) MRI, the vertebral body looks like a big round or oval structure in the FRONT. This is the part that can fracture in compression fractures or get invaded by tumors. Bodies stack on top of each other with discs in between. BODY = BULK = weight bearer!',

    '**Spinal Cord** = The gray circle in the middle! ‚≠ï\n\nüí° **Remember it:** On AXIAL (cross-section) spine MRI, the spinal cord looks like a GRAY CIRCLE in the middle of the spinal canal! It''s surrounded by bright CSF (on T2) which acts as a cushion. The cord is GRAY on T1 and T2 (intermediate signal). In the cervical and thoracic spine, the cord is continuous. In the lumbar spine, the CORD ENDS at L1-L2 (conus medullaris), and only nerve roots continue below (cauda equina). On axial, always look for that gray circle - that''s the precious spinal cord!',

    '**Transverse Process** = The side wings! ü¶Ö\n\nüí° **Remember it:** TRANSVERSE = ACROSS/SIDEWAYS = processes sticking out to the SIDES! Each vertebra has TWO transverse processes (left and right) projecting laterally (sideways). On axial MRI, they look like dark bony projections on each SIDE of the vertebral body and spinal canal. These are attachment points for muscles and ligaments. In the THORACIC spine, the RIBS also attach to the transverse processes! Think: TRANSVERSE = TRANS-verse (across) = side to side. NOT the spinous process (that''s the one pointing BACK). Transverse = side wings!',

The spinal cord doesn''t go all the way down to your tailbone - it ENDS at about the L1-L2 level as the CONUS MEDULLARIS. Below that, only nerve roots continue (called cauda equina = "horse''s tail"). On sagittal lumbar MRI, look for where the gray cord TAPERS and ENDS - that''s the conus! Below it, you''ll see individual nerve roots floating in CSF. If the conus is LOW (below L2), that''s a "low-lying conus" (can be normal or a tethered cord). CONUS = END CONE!',

    '**Abdominal Aorta** = The body''s main pipeline! ü´Ä\n\nüí° **Remember it:** The AORTA is the BIGGEST artery in your body! It comes down from the heart through the chest (thoracic aorta) and continues through the ABDOMEN (abdominal aorta) RIGHT IN FRONT of the lumbar spine. On sagittal lumbar MRI, you can see it as a tubular structure ANTERIOR (in front) to the vertebral bodies. It''s usually dark (flow void) on standard sequences or bright on special vascular sequences. The aorta carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. If it ruptures (AAA = abdominal aortic aneurysm), that''s a life-threatening emergency!',

On sagittal MRI, count the lumbar vertebral bodies from TOP to BOTTOM: L1 (first one below the last rib/T12), L2, L3 (middle one - usually around belly button level), L4, L5 (last one before sacrum). L3 is often used as a landmark - it''s roughly at the ILIAC CREST level. Each vertebral body is that rectangular bony structure (the weight-bearing part). L3 = middle = #3 in a 5-vertebra stack!',

This is the LUMBOSACRAL JUNCTION - where the mobile lumbar spine meets the fixed sacrum. It''s the MOST COMMON site for disc herniations in the lower back! This disc takes a LOT of stress because it''s at the transition point. On sagittal MRI, it''s the disc space at the VERY BOTTOM of the lumbar spine, right above the triangular sacrum.
