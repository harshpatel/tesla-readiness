Tissues with FEWER = DARKER. It''s not about T1 relaxation or T2 relaxation - it''s about the CONCENTRATION of protons! Think of it like counting how many people are in a room - more people = brighter signal. Water and fat both have lots of hydrogen, so they''re bright on PD.

(2) HIGH SNR - good signal-to-noise so you can SEE those tiny structures clearly! Use surface coils, optimize TR/TE. (3) PRECISE POSITIONING - if the knee is rotated, you can''t see the ACL properly!

The femoral condyles (the two rounded bumps at the bottom of the femur) run side-to-side. For sagittal knee images, you want to angle PERPENDICULAR (across) to those condyles, so your slices go front-to-back through the knee.

Think of the flow: Quadriceps muscle ‚û°Ô∏è Quadriceps TENDON ‚û°Ô∏è Patella (kneecap) ‚û°Ô∏è Patellar TENDON ‚û°Ô∏è Tibial tubercle.

    '**Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL)!** üéóÔ∏è\n\nüí° **Remember it:** ACL = the ligament that goes diagonally inside the knee! On sagittal MRI, it looks like a dark band running from the ANTERIOR (front) tibia going UP and BACK to the posterior femur. The ACL PREVENTS the tibia from sliding forward. It''s the most commonly TORN ligament in sports (basketball, soccer, skiing). Think: ACL = Anterior (front) Cruciate (cross-shaped) Ligament - it literally crosses inside your knee!',

It connects the bottom of the kneecap to the tibial tubercle (that bump on your shin). On sagittal MRI, it''s that dark band running from the bottom of the bright kneecap down to the tibia. This is what you HIT when doctors test your knee reflex! When the quadriceps contract, they pull the patellar tendon, which pulls the tibia forward, straightening your leg.

The tibia is the WEIGHT-BEARING bone of the lower leg (the fibula on the outside is thinner). Think: TIBia = TIny Bump - you can feel it right under your skin on the front of your shin (that''s why it hurts so much when you bang it!).

Pain, DJD (arthritis/worn cartilage), and AVN (avascular necrosis = dead bone from loss of blood supply) are all hip problems. But incontinence?

    '**Greater Trochanter = hip landmark!** ü¶¥\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Put your hand on your hip - that bony bump you feel on the SIDE is the GREATER TROCHANTER! It''s the big bony knob at the top of the femur where muscles attach. This gets you perfectly centered on the hip joint (where the femoral head sits in the acetabulum). Not the iliac crest (top of pelvis - too high), not the symphysis pubis (pubic bone - too low). Greater trochanter = the perfect hip landmark!',

Think of it like the rubber seal around a Tupperware lid - it creates a better "suction" seal for the femoral head. On MRI, it looks like a triangular dark structure at the edge of the socket.

Its TENDON wraps around the back of the hip and inserts on the greater trochanter. It''s a LATERAL (external) ROTATOR of the hip despite being called "internus"!

It''s the flat part of the scapula (shoulder blade) that extends over the top of the shoulder joint. The acromion forms the AC (acromioclavicular) joint with the clavicle. The space under the acromion (subacromial space) is where the supraspinatus tendon lives - if the space is too narrow, you get IMPINGEMENT! On coronal MRI, the acromion is that flat bone at the very top. Think: Acromion = At the Crown = the roof!',

    '**Biceps Tendon (Long Head)** = in the groove! üí™\n\nüí° **Remember it:** The LONG HEAD of the BICEPS TENDON runs through the bicipital groove (intertubercular groove) at the front of the humerus, then goes UP and over the humeral head to attach inside the shoulder joint at the top of the glenoid! On coronal MRI, you see it as a dark oval/circle in the groove between the greater and lesser tuberosities. This tendon can tear, get inflamed (tendinitis), or sublux (pop out of the groove).

    '**Glenoid** = the socket! ü•Ñ\n\nüí° **Remember it:** GLENOID = the shallow "socket" on the scapula (shoulder blade) where the humeral head (ball) sits. It''s called a "ball and socket" joint, but the glenoid is really more like a SHALLOW DISH or SAUCER - very flat! That''s why the shoulder dislocates easily compared to the hip (which has a deep socket). The labrum (cartilage rim) helps make it deeper. On coronal MRI, the glenoid is that flat bony surface facing the humeral head. Think: Glenoid = Golf tee (flat top)!',

    '**Labrum** = the rim seal! ‚≠ï\n\nüí° **Remember it:** The GLENOID LABRUM is a ring of fibrocartilage around the edge of the glenoid (socket) that makes it DEEPER and more stable. Think of it like the rubber gasket around a jar lid - it creates a better seal! On MRI, it looks like a small triangular dark structure at the rim of the glenoid. LABRAL TEARS (especially SLAP tears = Superior Labrum Anterior-Posterior) are common in throwing athletes and cause shoulder pain/instability. Labrum = the rim that keeps the ball in!',

It runs from the supraspinatus muscle (above the scapular spine) over the TOP of the humeral head to insert on the greater tuberosity. It''s responsible for the first 15¬∞ of shoulder abduction (lifting arm away from body). This tendon lives in the SUBACROMIAL SPACE under the acromion - when that space narrows (impingement), the tendon gets pinched and can tear.

The further from isocenter, the more INHOMOGENEOUS (non-uniform) the magnetic field becomes = worse image quality, more artifacts, poorer fat saturation! Ideally, you''d position the elbow OVERHEAD (Superman position) to get it at isocenter, but that''s uncomfortable. Side position = comfy but crummy field. Trade-offs!',

Biceps tendon tears often occur at this insertion point. The biceps muscle is in the upper arm (too far up), triceps muscle is in the back of the arm, and "triceps ligament insertion" isn''t really a thing.

It''s part of the ULNA. The olecranon fits into the olecranon fossa (groove) on the back of the humerus when you straighten your arm. The triceps tendon attaches here.

The trochlea is on the MEDIAL (pinky side) of the humerus. It''s shaped like a spool of thread with a groove in the middle.
