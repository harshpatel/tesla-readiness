    "explanation": "**Spinous Process** = The pointy part you can feel! üëÜ**\n\n\n---\n\nüí° **Remember it:**\n Run your hand down your back - those bumps you feel are SPINOUS PROCESSES! Each vertebra has a SPINOUS PROCESS sticking out the BACK (posterior). On sagittal MRI, they look like dark bony projections pointing backward. These are where back muscles attach and they act as levers for movement. In the cervical spine, C2-C6 have BIFID (split/forked) spinous processes, while C7 has a big single one (that's why C7 is called \"vertebra prominens\" - you can really feel it). Spinous = SPINE-LIKE = pointy!"

Think of vertebrae like a ring: the BODY is the thick front part (anterior), and the arch wraps around the back to protect the spinal cord. On axial (cross-section) MRI, the vertebral body looks like a big round or oval structure in the FRONT. This is the part that can fracture in compression fractures or get invaded by tumors. Bodies stack on top of each other with discs in between. BODY = BULK = weight bearer!"

It's surrounded by bright CSF (on T2) which acts as a cushion. The cord is GRAY on T1 and T2 (intermediate signal). In the cervical and thoracic spine, the cord is continuous. In the lumbar spine, the CORD ENDS at L1-L2 (conus medullaris), and only nerve roots continue below (cauda equina). On axial, always look for that gray circle - that's the precious spinal cord!"

Each vertebra has TWO transverse processes (left and right) projecting laterally (sideways). On axial MRI, they look like dark bony projections on each SIDE of the vertebral body and spinal canal. These are attachment points for muscles and ligaments. In the THORACIC spine, the RIBS also attach to the transverse processes! Think: TRANSVERSE = TRANS-verse (across) = side to side.

Below that, only nerve roots continue (called cauda equina = \"horse's tail\"). On sagittal lumbar MRI, look for where the gray cord TAPERS and ENDS - that's the conus! Below it, you'll see individual nerve roots floating in CSF. If the conus is LOW (below L2), that's a \"low-lying conus\" (can be normal or a tethered cord). CONUS = END CONE!"

The aorta carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. If it ruptures (AAA = abdominal aortic aneurysm), that's a life-threatening emergency!"
