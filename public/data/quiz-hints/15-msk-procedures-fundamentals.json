    "explanation": "**T2 and Proton Density contrast are minimized** in T1-weighted images! üéØ\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Weighting means ONE contrast is MAXIMIZED while OTHERS are MINIMIZED! T1-weighted = T1 contrast dominates, T2 and PD effects are suppressed. This is done with SHORT TR (to minimize T2) and SHORT TE (to minimize PD). Think: each weighting is like turning up ONE volume knob while turning down the others! T1W = great for anatomy (fat is bright, fluid is dark).
