    "hint": "Bone is SOLID calcium - no water, no mobile hydrogen!",
    "explanation": "**No mobile protons & no water** = no MRI signal! ü¶¥\n\nüí° **Remember it:** COMPACT BONE (cortical bone) has NO MOBILE PROTONS because it's mostly CALCIUM HYDROXYAPATITE (solid mineral). The few protons that exist are BOUND in crystal structure = can't move = can't create signal. No mobile protons = NO SIGNAL on ANY sequence. Dark on T1, dark on T2, dark on everything! Think: BONE = PHONE (off) = no signal!"

    "hint": "What are the THREE tissue properties that create contrast?",
    "explanation": "**T1, T2, and Proton Density** - the three contrast mechanisms! üé®\n\nüí° **Remember it:** The THREE FUNDAMENTAL CONTRAST MECHANISMS in MRI are based on tissue properties: **T1** (longitudinal recovery), **T2** (transverse decay), and **PROTON DENSITY** (number of mobile protons). We manipulate TR and TE to weight images by these properties. Think: **T**hree **T**ypes = **T**1, **T**2, and **P**roton **D**ensity!"

    "hint": "What are the STEPS in the sequence? Excite, encode, echo, encode!",
    "explanation": "**Slice excitation, Phase encoding, Echo generation, Frequency encoding!** üîÑ\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Every MRI pulse sequence has 4 KEY STEPS: 1) **SLICE EXCITATION** (RF pulse tips spins), 2) **PHASE ENCODING** (gradient encodes y-axis), 3) **ECHO GENERATION** (create the signal/echo), 4) **FREQUENCY ENCODING** (readout gradient encodes x-axis). Think: **S**lice, **P**hase, **E**cho, **F**requency = **SPEF** = the STEPS to make an image! TR/TE are timing parameters, not sequence parts."
