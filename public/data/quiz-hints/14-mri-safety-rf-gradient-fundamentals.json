They happen quietly, often go unreported, and can be DELAYED (patient doesn't notice until hours later). Common causes: looped cables, skin-to-skin contact, skin touching bore, tattoos, medication patches. EVERY scan has RF exposure, so RF burns are statistically way more frequent than rare projectile or quench events. Prevention: proper positioning, no loops, no metal contact! ü©π"

RF burns are different - they're caused by RF ENERGY heating tissue via: (A) LOOPED CABLES creating antennas, (B) SKIN TOUCHING THE BORE (body coil transmitter), (C) SKIN-TO-SKIN LOOPS (arms crossed, hands clasped, legs touching). All three create electrical loops that convert RF energy to heat. Arcing? That's a magnetic field projectile issue, not RF! Know the difference! üî•"
