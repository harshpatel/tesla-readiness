Unlike X-ray, CT, or nuclear medicine, MRI has NO cancer risk, NO DNA damage, NO cumulative radiation exposure.

Mass doesn't matter if it's not ferromagnetic (aluminum is light but safe). Distance to FRINGE FIELD doesn't matter - it's distance to the MAGNET CENTER that counts!

Cut distance in HALF ‚Üí force increases by 2¬≤ = 4x! This is WHY projectiles ACCELERATE as they get closer - the closer they get, the STRONGER the pull, the FASTER they go! Example: At 10 feet, small pull. At 5 feet (half distance), 4x stronger. At 2.5 feet (half again), 16x the original! This exponential increase is what makes the \"missile effect\" so dangerous!
