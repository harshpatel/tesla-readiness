    "explanation": "**Combining Forms** are the 4th building block! üß©**\n\n\n---\n\nüí° **Remember it:**\n Medical terms = PREFIX + WORD ROOT + SUFFIX + COMBINING FORM. The combining form is usually a vowel (like 'o' or 'i') that connects word parts to make pronunciation easier. Like 'cardi/o/logy' - the 'o' is the combining form that smoothly connects 'cardi' (heart) to 'logy' (study of)!"

    "explanation": "**Word Root** indicates the body part! üå≥**\n\n\n---\n\nüí° **Remember it:**\n The WORD ROOT is the MAIN PART - it tells you WHAT body part you're talking about. Cardi = heart, gastro = stomach, neuro = nerve, derma = skin. Everything else (prefixes, suffixes) just modifies this main body part!"

It MODIFIES the word root that comes after it!"

In medical terminology, these vowels are often used as combining forms. So A-E-I-O-U - you were missing the 'I'! Easy once you remember your vowels from grade school!"

When your body detects injury or infection, it sends blood and immune cells causing the area to be RED (blood flow), HOT (increased temperature), SWOLLEN (fluid buildup), PAINFUL.
