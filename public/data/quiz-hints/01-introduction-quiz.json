You cannot determine:**\n\n\n- **Magnetic field strength** (measured in Tesla)**\n\n- **System performance** or capabilities**\n\n- **Image quality** potential**\n\nJust by visual inspection.

    "explanation": "**D. A radio receiver and transmitter** is correct!**\n\nHere's the beautiful process:\n\n1. **Radio Receiver:** The body's protons absorb radio frequency (RF) energy when we transmit at their resonant frequency**\n2. **Radio Transmitter:** When the RF pulse stops, those same protons release that energy as radio waves that we detect**\n\n🎙️ **Think of it like this:** Your body becomes a tiny radio station!

Our receiver coils pick up these radio signals\n5.

      "A": "Raymond Damadian",
      "B": "Peter Mansfield",
      "C": "Paul Lauterbur",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "hint": "**Indomitable achievement:** This was done on July 3, 1977, using a scanner named 'Indomitable.' The first human scanned was actually one of Damadian's graduate students, Larry Minkoff!",
    "explanation": "**A. Raymond Damadian** performed the first whole-body human MRI scan!**\n\n🏥 **Historic Scan - July 3, 1977:**\n**\n- Scanner name: **\"Indomitable\"**\n**\n- First human subject: **Larry Minkoff** (Damadian's graduate student)**\n\n- Scan time: Nearly **5 hours!**\n**\n- Location: Brooklyn, New York\n\n- Image: Crude by today's standards, but revolutionary!\n\n🔬 **Why this was different:**\n**\n- **Lauterbur (1976):** First image of living tissue (small samples)**\n\n- **Damadian (1977):** First WHOLE HUMAN BODY scan**\n\n- Big enough to fit a person\n\n- Clinical potential proven\n\n⚡ **\"Indomitable\" Facts:**\n**\n- Weighed several tons\n\n- Required patient to remain completely still for hours\n\n- No gradient coils like modern MRI\n\n- Now in the Smithsonian Institution!\n\n**Fun fact:** Damadian wanted to be the first person scanned, but he was too large to fit in his own machine!**\n\n---\n\n💡 **Remember:** *Damadian's whole-body scan in '77 - opened MRI's door to heaven!*"

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "hint": "**The controversial Nobel:** One pioneered spatial encoding and made the first image. The other developed echo-planar imaging for fast scanning. A third major contributor was notably excluded from this prize!",
    "explanation": "**D. Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur** shared the 2003 Nobel Prize!**\n\n🏆 **The Winners:**\n**\n**Paul Lauterbur (1929-2007):**\n**\n- Discovered how to create images using gradient fields\n\n- First MRI image (1973)\n\n- Introduced spatial encoding concept\n\n**Peter Mansfield (1933-2017):**\n**\n- Developed **Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI)**\n**\n- Made MRI much faster (seconds instead of hours)\n\n- Advanced mathematical techniques for image reconstruction\n\n⚖️ **The Controversy:**\n**\n- **Raymond Damadian** was NOT included**\n\n- He had the first patent (1974)\n\n- Did the first whole-body human scan (1977)\n\n- Showed tumors have different NMR signals (1971)\n\n- He publicly protested the decision\n\n📰 **The Debate:**\n**\n- Some say Damadian deserved inclusion\n\n- Others argue Lauterbur and Mansfield made the imaging breakthroughs\n\n- Nobel committee doesn't explain their decisions\n\n---\n\n💡 **Remember:** *Mansfield and Lauterbur won the Nobel crown - but Damadian's work won't be let down!*"
