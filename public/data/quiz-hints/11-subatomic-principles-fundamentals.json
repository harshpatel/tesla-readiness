    "hint": "Not along Z, but ACROSS from it - the XY plane!",
    "explanation": "**Transverse** - the magic signal plane! ‚ú®\n\nüí° **Remember it:** TRANSVERSE = XY plane = where the SIGNAL lives! Mz (longitudinal) is invisible to receiver coils - it's like a spinning top perfectly upright (no wobble to detect). But Mxy (transverse) is like a wobbling top - that wobble creates CHANGING magnetic fields that INDUCE current in receiver coils (Faraday's Law!). RF pulses FLIP Mz INTO transverse plane so we can detect it. No Mxy = no signal = no image! üì°"

    "explanation": "**The same** - synonyms in MRI! üéØ\n\nüí° **Remember it:** LARMOR FREQUENCY = RESONANT FREQUENCY! Just different names for the same thing. Larmor frequency is the NATURAL precession frequency of protons in a magnetic field (calculated by Larmor equation). Resonant frequency is the frequency at which protons will ABSORB RF energy. They're the SAME because resonance occurs when transmitted frequency MATCHES natural precession frequency! Like pushing a swing at its natural frequency! üîä"

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "hint": "Use Larmor equation! Divide frequency by gyromagnetic ratio!",
    "explanation": "**3.0T** - simple math using Larmor equation! üßÆ\n\nüí° **Remember it:** œâ = Œ≥ √ó B‚ÇÄ, so B‚ÇÄ = œâ / Œ≥! Given: Œ≥ = 42.6 MHz/T, œâ = 127.8 MHz. Calculate: B‚ÇÄ = 127.8 √∑ 42.6 = **3.0 Tesla!** This is why different field strengths need different RF frequencies: 1.5T = 63.9 MHz, 3T = 127.8 MHz, 7T = 298.2 MHz. Higher field = higher frequency needed for resonance! Always remember the Larmor equation - it's your best friend! üìê"

    "explanation": "**TRUE!** ‚úÖ In phase = constructive interference! üí™\n\nüí° **Remember it:** IN PHASE = vectors ADD UP = STRONGER! Think of pushing a swing together at the same time vs randomly - synchronized pushing makes it go HIGHER! When waves are in phase, their peaks align and ADD together (constructive interference). Two 1V signals in phase = 2V combined! This is WHY phase coherence matters in MRI - in-phase spins produce STRONG signal. Dephased spins cancel out = WEAK signal. Phase = everything in MRI! üåä"
