On MRI, acute stroke/ischemia shows up as a wedge-shaped area following a specific artery's territory (MCA, ACA, PCA). It's BRIGHT on DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) and DARK on ADC map.

Then count down: C3, C4, C5, C6, C7. The DISC is named for the vertebrae above and below it. So C5-C6 disc sits between the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies.
