          "hint": "Think: PHYSIO = HOW things work, not WHAT they look like!",
          "explanation": "**Physiology** = How the body FUNCTIONS! ‚öôÔ∏è\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Anatomy tells you WHAT it looks like (structure), Physiology tells you HOW it works (function)! Like knowing a car has an engine (anatomy) vs. understanding how that engine makes the car move (physiology)!"

          "explanation": "**Pathology** = Study of DISEASE! üî¨\n\nüí° **Remember it:** PATH-ology is the study of what's on the wrong PATH (disease). Pathologists examine tissues and diagnose diseases. In MRI, understanding pathology helps you identify abnormalities in scans!"

          "explanation": "**Protection** is the PRIMARY function! ü¶¥\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Your skeleton is like ARMOR protecting your vital organs! Skull protects the brain, ribcage guards the heart and lungs, vertebrae shield the spinal cord. Yes, bones also help with movement, but protection is #1!"

          "explanation": "**TRUE!** Tendons bridge TWO systems! üåâ\n\nüí° **Remember it:** TENDONS attach MUSCLE to BONE - so they're literally part of BOTH systems! Think of your Achilles tendon connecting your calf muscle to your heel bone. Without tendons, muscles couldn't move bones!"

          "explanation": "**Bone to Bone!** Ligaments are joint stabilizers! üîó\n\nüí° **Remember it:** LIG = LINK bones together! Ligaments keep your joints stable (like your knee or elbow). TENDONS connect muscle to bone, LIGAMENTS connect bone to bone. In MRI, torn ligaments (like ACL tears) are common findings!"

          "explanation": "**Tissue** is the next level! üß¨\n\nüí° **Remember the hierarchy:** CELLS ‚Üí TISSUES ‚Üí ORGANS ‚Üí SYSTEMS. Many similar cells working together = TISSUE. Like muscle cells form muscle tissue, nerve cells form nervous tissue. Then tissues combine to make organs (like the heart)!"

          "explanation": "**Energy** (ATP)! Mitochondria = Cellular Power Plants! ‚ö°\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Mitochondria are the POWERHOUSE of the cell - they convert food into ATP (cellular energy). Without mitochondria, cells couldn't function! Fun fact: Your body makes about 50 kg of ATP per DAY!"

          "explanation": "**Epithelial** tissue completes the fab four! üéØ\n\nüí° **Remember the 4 tissue types:** CONNECTIVE (holds things together), MUSCLE (moves), NERVOUS (senses & controls), EPITHELIAL (covers & lines). Epithelial tissue is like wallpaper - it covers your skin and lines your organs!"

          "explanation": "**Cardiac** muscle - for the heart! üí™\n\nüí° **Remember the 3 muscle types:** SKELETAL (voluntary - you control), SMOOTH (involuntary - organs), CARDIAC (heart only - involuntary). In MRI, cardiac imaging specifically looks at this special muscle tissue that never gets tired!"

          "explanation": "**Dendrites** RECEIVE signals! üå≥\n\nüí° **Remember it:** DENDrites = branches that RECEIVE messages (think tree branches catching raindrops). AXON = highway that SENDS messages away. In neuro MRI, you're looking at these neural pathways!"

          "points": 1,
          "hint": "INTER-phase = the phase BETWEEN divisions, where cells grow!",
          "explanation": "**Interphase** = Growth phase! üìà\n\nüí° **Remember it:** Cell cycle = INTERPHASE (growth & prep) + MITOSIS (division). Think INTER = BETWEEN divisions. During interphase, cells grow, copy their DNA, and prepare to divide. It's like training before the big game (mitosis)!"

          "explanation": "**Cell Nucleus** divides in mitosis! üß¨\n\nüí° **Remember it:** MITOSIS = NUCLEAR division (DNA splits). The nucleus divides first, THEN the cytoplasm divides (that's cytokinesis). Result = 2 identical daughter cells with the same DNA!"

          "explanation": "**Facing Forward!** Palms = handshake position! ü§ù\n\nüí° **Remember Anatomical Position:** Standing UPRIGHT, facing FORWARD, arms at SIDES, palms facing FORWARD (like ready to shake hands). This is the STANDARD reference for ALL anatomical descriptions in MRI and medicine!"

          "explanation": "**Left-Right** division! üèπ\n\nüí° **Remember it:** SAGITTAL plane splits you into LEFT and RIGHT halves (like slicing bread). MID-sagittal = exactly down the middle. In MRI, sagittal images show your profile view! Coronal = front/back, Transverse (axial) = top/bottom."

          "explanation": "**Liver** is #1 INTERNAL organ! ü´Å\n\nüí° **Remember it:** LIVER is the largest INTERNAL organ (~3 lbs/1.5 kg). Skin is the largest organ OVERALL, but it's external. The liver does 500+ jobs including detox, digestion, and storing vitamins. In MRI, liver imaging is super common!"
