          "explanation": "**False!** This is a common misconception. MRI systems of different field strengths (0.3T, 1.5T, 3T, even 7T) can look nearly identical externally. You cannot determine:\n\n- **Magnetic field strength** (measured in Tesla)\n- **System performance** or capabilities\n- **Image quality** potential\n\nJust by visual inspection. The differences are internal - in the magnet design, gradient systems, and RF technology.

          "explanation": "**D. A radio receiver and transmitter** is correct!\n\nHere's the beautiful process:\n\n1. **Radio Receiver:** The body's protons absorb radio frequency (RF) energy when we transmit at their resonant frequency\n2. **Radio Transmitter:** When the RF pulse stops, those same protons release that energy as radio waves that we detect\n\nüéôÔ∏è **Think of it like this:** Your body becomes a tiny radio station! We send out a signal, the protons tune in and absorb it, then broadcast it back to us.

Proton** is the star of MRI!\n\nHere's why protons are perfect:\n\nüéØ **Abundance:** Hydrogen protons are everywhere in the body (in water, fat, proteins)\nüß≤ **Magnetic:** Protons have a magnetic moment - they act like tiny bar magnets\nüìª **Responsive:** They can absorb and emit radio frequency energy\n‚ö° **Spin:** They have nuclear spin, making them resonate at specific frequencies\n\n**Why not the others?**\n- Electrons: Too light and fast-moving\n- Neutrons: No charge, can't be detected this way\n- Photons: These are light particles, not the target of MRI\n\nüí° **Remember:** *P is for Proton, P is for Power in MRI!*",

          "explanation": "**A. Resonant Frequency** is correct!\n\nüéµ **Musical Analogy:** Just like each musical note has a specific frequency (A = 440 Hz), each proton in a magnetic field has a specific resonant frequency where it will absorb energy most efficiently.\n\n**Why it matters in MRI:**\n- At 1.5T, hydrogen protons resonate at ~63.9 MHz\n- At 3T, they resonate at ~127.8 MHz\n- We must transmit at EXACTLY this frequency for energy transfer\n- Off frequency = no signal = no image!\n\nüéº **Think of it like this:** The Larmor frequency (another name for resonant frequency) is like the proton's favorite song - it only dances when it hears that exact tune!\n\nüí° **Remember:** *Right frequency = Resonance = Energy transfer = MRI magic!*",

          "explanation": "**A. Releases the energy in the form of a radio wave** is correct!\n\nThis is called **T1 and T2 relaxation:**\n\nüì° **The Process:**\n1. RF pulse ON ‚Üí Protons absorb radio energy and get excited\n2. RF pulse OFF ‚Üí Protons return to their low-energy state\n3. As they relax, they emit radio waves at the same frequency\n4. Our receiver coils pick up these radio signals\n5. Computer converts signals into an image!\n\nü™É **Think boomerang:** You throw radio energy at the protons, they catch it, then throw it right back to you as a radio signal!\n\n**Not light, not sound, not just heat** - it's radio waves all the way. That's why MRI is also called **MR** (Magnetic Resonance) - it's all about that resonant radio frequency!\n\nüí° **Remember:** *RF goes in, RF comes out - that's the MRI shout!*",

          "hint": "**Signal strength = brightness:** More signal means more information means more brightness on the image. It's like turning up the volume on your radio - stronger signal = clearer reception!",
          "explanation": "**B. Bright rather than dark** is correct!\n\nüîÜ **The Brightness Rule:**\n- **Strong signal** = High signal intensity = **Bright pixels (hyperintense)**\n- **Weak signal** = Low signal intensity = **Dark pixels (hypointense)**\n- **No signal** = No intensity = **Black (signal void)**\n\n**What creates strong signals?**\n- Water-rich tissues (CSF, fluid)\n- Fat (appears bright on T1)\n- Tissues with many mobile protons\n\n**What creates weak signals?**\n- Dense bone (cortical)\n- Air\n- Fast-flowing blood\n- Dense fibrous tissue\n\nüì∫ **Think TV reception:** Strong broadcast signal = clear, bright picture.

          "explanation": "**A. Fourier Transform** is the mathematical heart of MRI!\n\nüéº **What is Fourier Transform?**\n- Mathematical method developed by Joseph Fourier (1768-1830)\n- Converts signals from the **frequency domain** to the **spatial domain**\n- Breaks down complex signals into simple sine waves\n- Reconstructs them into an image\n\nüñºÔ∏è **How it works in MRI:**\n1. Protons emit radio signals at various frequencies\n2. Signals are encoded with spatial information\n3. Computer collects this \"raw data\" (K-space)\n4. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** processes the data\n5. Out comes your MRI image!\n\n**Without Fourier Transform:**\n- We'd have frequency data but no image\n- No way to reconstruct spatial information\n- MRI simply wouldn't work!\n\nüéµ **Musical analogy:** Like taking a recording of an orchestra and separating out each instrument's individual sound.\n\nüí° **Remember:** *Fourier Transform is the key - turns signals into what we see!*",
